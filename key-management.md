# Key Management

BlockSwift implements strict key management protocols to secure our validator operations:

## Validator Identity Key Security

- Generated using air-gapped hardware
- Private keys are never stored on internet-connected devices
- Multi-signature governance for withdrawal authority
- Hardware security modules for key operations

## Key Separation

We implement separation of duties through key segregation:

- **Vote Account**: Separate from withdrawal authority
- **Withdrawal Authority**: Multi-signature with strict governance
- **Validator Identity**: Protected by strict access controls

## Backup Procedures

- Encrypted backups stored in geographically separate locations
- Regular key recovery drills to ensure business continuity
- Documentation of recovery procedures with trusted team members

## Access Controls

- Strict need-to-know basis for key-related information
- Multi-factor authentication required for all key management systems
- Detailed logging of all key-related activities
